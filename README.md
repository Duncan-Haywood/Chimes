TitleOfApp is a generative music synthesizer based on the Otomata app.  Sounds are generated by blocks that move back and forth across a 9 by 9 grid.  When a block hits a wall, it plays a note based on the position hit, and reverses direction.  When two blocks collide (move to the same grid square at the same time), they both rotate 90% and keep moving.  When two blocks are in adjacent squares, they do not collide but pass through each other.
